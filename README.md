# Lab-Work 2

This is the repository for the Lab-Work 2 on Colaboratory.

## Introduction
In this lab-work, we studied different structures of deep convolutional neural networks to work on image classification using the PyTorch library.
We used the CIFAR10 database with ten categories of objects.
The notebook guided us to construct an artificial neural network to classify them.

## Report
The report is in the repository, named Lab2.pdf. It contains approximatively all the relevant tests I have done in this Lab-Work.
